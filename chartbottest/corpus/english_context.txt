When is the moon
Ask wine blue sky.
I do not know the sky palace,
What day is it?
I want to go by the wind,
Also fear Qiong Lou Yu Yu,
Almost unspeakable.
Dance to clarify the shadow,
What seems to be in the world!

Turn Zhuge,
Low Yee households,
According to no sleep.
There should be no hate,
What time to round the other time?
There are joys and sorrows,
There is a full moon,
It's been a long time ago.
I hope people long,
A total of thousands of miles Chan Juan.
